How It Works

    Quiz Class: The core functionality is handled by the Quiz class which manages the score, the list of questions, and the current question index.
    Question Class: Each question is instantiated with the question text, possible choices, and the correct answer.
    Display Logic: The application dynamically updates the DOM to display questions and choices based on user interactions.
    Timer: A countdown timer runs concurrently with the quiz, which alerts the user when the time is up.

Code Structure

    Quiz Class: Manages the overall quiz state including current score and question index.
    Question Class: Represents each question and checks if the answer is correct.
    Display Functions: Functions such as displayQuestion, showScores, and showProgress are used to manipulate the user interface.
    Timer Functionality: The countdown is managed using a setInterval function to update the remaining time.
